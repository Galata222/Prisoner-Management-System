        <b> Harar town prison is one of the most popular prisons around in Harare region. In fact, this
            governmental organization uses the traditional way of file managing system which is a very tedious
            and time-wasting activity having this in mind our team choose this system to be automated. As a
            result, the objective of the project is to design and develop a prison managementsystem for
            prisoners in order to handle prisoners' information and record in an automated way. In Harar
            prison administration organization has several activities performs but to facilitate their activity the
            organization uses a manual system. <br> good system for prison service should be automated because
            it enhances the administration and experience to design, develop and implement a prison
            management system for prison defense and security. In developed countries of the world, people
            are already fighting over how prisoners can gain access to the internet in their cell rooms or their
            common rooms.<br> Since this organization uses a traditional way of file managing system which
            is a very tediousand time-wasting activity. Due to this reason, it is hard to manage prisoners'
            information, which easily data loss, use much space, and human power and security problem exist
            in the organization.<br> To improve this manual activity our team, develop a system which will reduce
            manual work and time-wasting activity than before. Generally, the proposed system focused on
            registering, managing, storing, and evaluating all prisoner information easily through a
            computerized way in the organization.</b>
